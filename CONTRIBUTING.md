Thank you for your interest in helping out on Claws!

If you're filing a bug report, make sure to provide the full stack trace (if possible), or any result from the console that is unexpected.

If you want to work on a feature you'd deem useful, please make an issue first! We wouldn't want your precious time be wasted because in the end the feature shouldn't be included in the project.

If you have any doubts, please get in touch with me via [Telegram](https://t.me/dahhowl), [Email](mailto:the@howl.moe), or [Mastodon](https://mstdn.io/@Howl).
